The dataset in question, meticulously collected via the process of web scraping from the widely recognized U.S. platform dedicated to pre-owned automobiles, Truecars.com, embodies a comprehensive arrangement of information encapsulated within six distinct columns. These columns, upon thorough analysis and manipulation, possess the potential to be transformed and expanded into an array of additional features through the process known as feature engineering. This dataset stands out as exceptionally conducive for the construction and refinement of regression models, owing to its rich and diverse content, which offers ample opportunities for exploring correlations, patterns, and predictive insights within the realm of automotive market dynamics.

The machine learning algorithm that I used  for this dataset is GRADIENT BOOST model.
